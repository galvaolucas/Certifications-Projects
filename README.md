In this repository you will find some of the challenges and programs that i've made while studying.

Most of them are from Hackerrank!

Flipping Bits:
You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits (1 and 0) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

#Example

n = 9 base 10;
9 base 10 = 1001 base 2;

. We're working with 32 bits, so:
